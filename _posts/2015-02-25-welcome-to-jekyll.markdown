I'm a recently new consultant developer. Basically my job involves me showing up on a client site and figuring everything as fast as possible. It's only been a year and I'm still working on that whole fast as possible thing, but here is what I know about figuring it out.

This is by know means a finished list, but simply a first pass at what I think it takes to be a good consultant developer.

### 1. Learn the check in dance as fast as possible. 

There is nothing worse than getting stuck in git hell. It's demoralizing and stressful. Not to mention dealing with complex merge conflicts tends to leave the code that you spent all day writing messed up to the point of not being able to be checked in.

If you learn anything day one on a new client, learn how to check in code. If your working with someone else, make sure you drive for all the checking in, checking out and merging. Even if you can't contribute to the functional story, being able to manage the team repo is will your life so much easier and the rest of the team.

You can't always avoid git hell, but you can avoid stupid mistakes. Every team has their own positives and negatives when it comes to managing their repos. Learn the postives and know how to manipulate them to your advantage. Memorize the negatives and every way to avoid them.

### 2. Learn the testing strategy 

Start out easy. Learn how to run the tests. It's going to be different than how to run the code. If you can't run the tests, your going to have no idea what you broke. And you are going to break code when on-boarding. Learn how to run them, debug them, and the services that they depend on.

Know this stuff is just as important has knowing the code. When on-boarding I find that I know how to write the code I want, but I do not know how this code will integrate with the existing system. If I don't understand how to run and write tests then I'm coding blind. And that is just plain terrifying.

Also, keep in mind that no testing strategy is ever perfect (or at least none that I have seen). The sooner you learn the limitations of the testing strategy the sooner you will be able to understand when/why your build will go red and how you could get false green builds. 

### 3. Be a chameleon

I'm a 25 year old female. My hobbies include shopping, trashy novels, and pedicures. As a consultant I show up on a client site and there is normally a forty year old white man. This man has been working on the code base for about as long as I have been alive. Not only that, but he can name every business rule and edge case that I will have to deal with. And he could do it in his sleep if he had too.

My goal: get this man to like me. I need this person to succeed. I'm never going to know the domain like he does (and I never want to) also, more than likely everything in his head is not written down. People are much more likely to help those they like, so I need to be liked.

So how do I make friends with a man twice my age who I have nothing in common with? Fake it. I ask them about their weekend, their family, their kids, whatever it takes to get them talking. I normally cannot relate to them, but I try. If he likes baseball, I pay a little more attention to the sports run down on the news. If he has kids, I make sure to ask what they enjoy doing. People love it when you take an interest in them. So I do, and I hope that they like me for it.

I'm not going to agree with everything this man says. We are going to argue, disagree, and hate each other at times. But we need each other. I want us to be able to go to lunch and shoot the shit. Not only because I need him, but also because we have to work together. I want him to think of me as a friend. For both our sakes. 

### 4. Do the obvious 

Learn the architecture. Not the architecture on paper (though that is probably important to at least keep noted somewhere), but learn the real work flow of the code. To be honest, I find this to be the easiest part. As a developer, I know how to read code, so I try not to let this part stress me out.

Most people want to start at this step. Read the code, learn it inside out, see changes that can/should be made. Add it's so easy to get sucked into this. This is the area I'm most comfortable with, write and reading code. But its also the area that I will struggle with the least. So I try to remind not spend all my time reading through the code base.
